					<description>An ancientportable graser turret. May explode when damaged. Its dumb AI brain can't be directly controlled, so beware of friendly fire.\n\nThis structure was built by a long forgotten civilisation and the technology can no longer be replicated. It will never suffer breakdowns, and it operates more efficiently during solar flare incidents.</description>
